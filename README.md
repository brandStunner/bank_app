Overview
This is a beginner-friendly command-line bank application written in Python using only basic functions and a wrapper dictionary for managing state. The app allows users to create bank accounts, deposit and withdraw money, check balances, and view all accounts.

Features
Create new bank accounts with unique account numbers

Deposit money into existing accounts

Withdraw money with balance validation

Check individual account balance

View a list of all existing accounts

How It Works
Account data is stored in a single account_state dictionary, which contains an account counter and a dictionary of all account records.

Each function interacts with the account_state dictionary to perform operations without using global variables directly.

Account numbers are automatically generated by incrementing the counter.

Requirements
Python 3.x

No external libraries are required.

Notes
